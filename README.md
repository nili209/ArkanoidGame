# Arkanoid Game  
## Overview  
I developed this game in my first yaer in the university.  
In the main screen there are 3 options:  
1. **High Score:**- a table with the names of the best players.  
2. **Quit Game:**- leave the game.  
3. **Start Game:**- begin a new game.  
A game can be one of the follows: easy, hard or super duper and the player can choose one of them in the beggining of the game.
